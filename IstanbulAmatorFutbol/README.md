# IstanbulAmatorFutbol

This is a short toy project I did in Istanbul. Everyweek, the Istanbul Amateur Football Referee Association announces the match referees on their website in an excel sheet. The average number of matches in the city per week is > 1000 matches. Referees would then find their names in the list. Usually, a referee would have 2-3 matches per week.

This little project, for about a year, served as an easy way for referees to search their match history and the matches they have for the current week.

Plans for 2016 version: automatic html page creation, top 10 (busy refs), refs that work on two fields in one day (hardworking refs), elite 10 (busy SAL refs), haftanin efso maclar
